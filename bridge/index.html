<h1>Complex Numbers, bridge example</h1>

<div class='box-1-1'>
  
  <p>Complex numbers appear often in engineering; the suspension of a
  car, the electronics in a phone, skyscrapers and bridges all use
  complex numbers in their design. However, the most important (and
  interesting) examples are advanced&mdash;so, when you <i>start</i>
  learning about complex numbers it can appear that they have little
  practical use. This is far from true.</p>
  
  <p>The two pillars of engineering mathematics are differential
  equations and linear algebra; complex numbers feature in both. Below
  we investigate the <a href='https://youtu.be/3mclp9QmCGs'>
  self-destruction of a bridge</a> and the differential equation that
  shows us what went wrong. If you've never seen a differential
  equation, don't worry; we'll take small steps. If you know what
  $\frac{dy}{dt}$ means, you'll be fine.<p>

  <p> Say we are designing some <i>dynamic system</i>&mdash;something
  that changes with time, like a car's suspension when it hits a
  bump. That system is likely descibed by a differential
  equation. That is, an equation involving differentials of some
  quantity (say $y$). Just for example, consider</p>
  
  $$ \frac{dy}{dt}+y=0 $$
    
  <p>It's worth pausing to think just what this equation says. There
  is a function of time, $y=y(t)$; we don't know what it is (but we'd
  like to); we only know that the sum of the function and its first
  derivative is zero. Most often we get equations like this from the
  underlying physics (or chemistry, or whatever)&mdash;we get
  <i>clues</i>, but not the solution.</p>
  
  <p>Typically a solution to the differential equations you'll
  encounter (including the one above) is</p>

  $$ y=e^{st} $$

  <p> where $s=\sigma+i\omega$ is a <b>complex</b> number that we have
  to (somehow) find. For example, say $s=-1+i0$. (OK, this is not
  <i>truly</i> complex ... but hang in there.) Then, substituting into
  the differential equations gives</p>

  $$
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{dy}{dt}+y &=& se^{st}+e^{st} \nonumber \\
  &=& -1e^{-t}+e^{t} \nonumber \\
  &=& 0
  \end{eqnarray}
  $$

  <p>In other words, $y=e^{st}$, with $s=-1$ is $y=e^{-t}$ and is a
  solution to the differential equation. More generally though, what
  does $y=e^{st}$ look like for a genuinely complex value of $s$?
  Consider:</p>

  $$ 
  \begin{eqnarray} 
  y &=& e^{st} \nonumber \\ 
  &=& e^{(\sigma+i\omega)t} \nonumber \\ 
  &=& e^{\sigma t + i\omega t} \nonumber \\
  &=& e^{\sigma t}e^{i\omega t} \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray} $$

  <p> We know how $e^{i\omega t}$ behaves from an <a href=''>earlier
  lecture</a>. Recall that $e^{i\theta}$ is a point in the complex
  plane at angle $\theta$ and modulus of one&mdash;so $e^{i\omega t}$
  is a point whose angle ($\omega t$) changes as time $t$
  increases. In other words, $e^{i\omega t}$ draws a circle in the
  complex plane.</p>

  <div id='lecture-slider-t'></div>
  <div id='lecture-plot-w'></div>

  <p> On the other hand, $e^{\sigma t}$ is just a regular exponential
  function. For positive values of $\sigma$, as $t$ increases,
  $e^{\sigma t}$ will get bigger, and for negative values of $\sigma$,
  $e^{\sigma t}$ will get smaller.
  </p>

  <div id='lecture-slider-a'></div>
  <div id='lecture-plot-a'></div>
    
  <p>When we multiply $e^{\sigma t}$ and $e^{i\omega t}$ to get
  $e^{st}$, we combine both behaviours&mdash;the first term changes
  the modulus, and the second term causes a rotation in the complex
  plane.</p>
    
  <div id='lecture-slider-real'></div>
  <div id='lecture-slider-imag'></div>
  <div id='lecture-plot-s'></div>

  <p> How did we know that the right value of $s$ above was $s=-1$?
  Just substitute $y=e^{st}$ into the differential equation and solve
  for $s$:</p>

  $$
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{dy}{dt} + y = 0 \nonumber \\
  s e^{st} + e^{st} = 0 \nonumber \\
  s \cancel{e^{st}} + \cancel{e^{st}} = 0 \nonumber \\
  s + 1 = 0 \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  $$

  <p> Obviously, then, the solution is $s=-1$. And, our recipe to
  solve differential equations is: substitute $y=e^{st}$ and solve for
  $s$. </p>

  <p>Important problems, such as <a
  href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling'>Newton's
  law of cooling</a> are close cousins of the differential equation
  above. But, we need to go a little further&mdash;be just a little
  more ambitious&mdash;to understand what happened to the bridge.</p>
     
  <p>Say $y$ is the angle of the bridge's (dynamic) twisting. Physics
  tells us something about <i>about</i> $y$:</p>

  $$ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 2\zeta\frac{dy}{dt} + y=0 $$
  
  <p>Here $\zeta$ (zeta) is a <i>designed
  parameter</i>&mdash;engineers selected it through their selection of
  the bridges materials and structure. We can solve this equation with
  the same recipe as above; substituting $y=e^{st}$ we have</p>

  $$ \begin{eqnarray} 
  s^2\cancel{e^{st}}+2\zeta s \cancel{e^{st}} + \cancel{e^{st}} &=& 0 \nonumber \\ 
  s^2+2\zeta s + 1 &=& 0 \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray} 
  $$

  <p>Now solve for $s$ by completing the square: </p>
    
  $$ 
  \begin{eqnarray} 
  s^2+2\zeta s + 1 &=& 0 \nonumber \\
  s^2 + 2\zeta s +(\zeta^2 - \zeta^2) + 1 &=& 0 \nonumber \\
  (s^2 + 2\zeta s + \zeta^2) - \zeta^2 + 1 &=& 0 \nonumber \\
  (s+\zeta)^2-\zeta^2+1&=&0 \nonumber \\
  (s+\zeta)^2&=&\zeta^2-1 \nonumber \\
    s+\zeta &=& \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} \nonumber \\ 
  s &=& -\zeta \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray} 
  $$

  <p> Let's say $\zeta$ is greater than -1 but less than zero
  ($-1<\zeta<0$). Then, the value inside the square-root above is
  <i>negative</i>, and so the square-root itself is the
  <b>imaginary</b> part of $s$. The <b>real</b> part of $s$ is the bit
  that <i>isn't</i> in the square root:</p>

  $$
  \sigma = -\zeta
  $$

  <p> Can you see what happened to the bridge? Note that $\sigma$ is
  <i>positive</i> because $\zeta$ is <i>negative</i>. Recalling that $
  y = e^{st} = e^{\sigma t}e^{i\omega t}$&mdash;what happens to
  $e^{\sigma t}$ as $t$ gets large (i.e., as time progresses)?</p>

  <p> If you were the engineer that designed the bridge, what value of
  $\zeta$ would you choose? (Hint: consider $0<\zeta<1$).</p>

  <p>Many engineers hardly ever consider differential equations
  directly (if at all). Instead, complex numbers allow them to focus
  just on the critical values of $s$&mdash;since these determine the
  behaviour of their system. Technically, these special complex
  numbers are known as the "poles" and "zeros" (something to look
  forward to at engineering school).</p>
  
  <p>Finally, let's consider what $y=y(t)$ really looks like. The
  quadratic equation gave us two values for $s$ (from the $\pm$ of the
  square root)&mdash;call them $s_1$ and $s_2$. By themselves,
  $e^{s_1t}$ and $e^{s_2}t$ are complex&mdash;but the twist of the
  bridge is <i>real</i>. The trick is to use <b>both</b> values for
  $s$: $y=e^{s_1t}+e^{s_2t}$. We'll skip the detail, but the plot
  shows the result (the initial value of $y$, at $t=0$, is normalized
  to the initial twist).</p>

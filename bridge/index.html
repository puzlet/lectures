<h1>Complex Numbers, bridge example</h1>

<div class='box-2-1'>
  
  <p>Complex numbers appear often in science and engineering. The
    suspension of your car, the electronics in your phone, skyscrapers
    and bridges all use complex numbers in their design.</p>

  <p>However, the most important (and interesting) examples are
    advanced&mdash;so, when you <i>start</i> learning about complex
    numbers it can appear that they have little practical use. This is
    far from true.</p>
  
  <p>Differential equations are just about the most powerful
    mathematical tool available. By themselves, they are too advanced
    for us today. But, with complex numbers we can transform a
    differential equation into a (much easier) quadratic equation.</p>
  
   <h2>Extending Eulers equation</h2>

  <p>From Eulers equation you know that for an imaginary number $ib$

    $$ e^{ib} = \cos b + i\sin b $$

    Its a small step so consider a complex number $a+ib$

    $$ e^{a+ib} = e^{a}e^{ib} = e^{a} \left( \cos b + i\sin b
    \right)$$

    And, just a hop to multiply the complex number by time, $t$

    $$ e^{st} = e^{(a+ib)t} = e^{at}e^{ibt} = e^{at} \left( \cos bt +
    i\sin bt \right)$$

    It mightn't look like much, $e^{st}$ is the most important
    solution to the most important class of differential equations
    (which are the most important tool in all of mathematics). All you
    need to do is work out what $s$ is.

  </p>

  <h2>Eigenstuff</h2>

  If you know anything about the function $f(x)=e^x$, you know that
  differention doesn't affect it. Now, if you know the chain-rule
  
  $$\frac{d}{dt} e^{st} = se^{st}$$

  Lets consider our first (and the simplest) differential equation:

  $$ \frac{dy}{dt}=0 $$

  To solve it, we assume $e^{st}$ is a solution for some value of
  $s$. To find $s$, substitute $y=e^{st}$ above to find

  $$ se^{st} = 0 $$
  
  You can easily see that this equation is solved by $s=0$, so a solution is

  $$ y = e^{st} = e^{0t} = 1 $$

  <h2>Bridge</h2>

  <p> Although we only solved a very simple differential equation, the <i>recipe</i> can
  be applied to much more interesting problems. Including the design
  of bridges. First watch this short
  <a href='https://youtu.be/3mclp9QmCGs'>video</a>.  The design of
  this bridge used the wrong complex number.</p>

  <p> The equation for the angle of twist ($\phi$) of the bridge is

    $$ \frac{d^2\phi}{t^2} + 2\zeta\frac{d\phi}{dt} + \phi=0 $$
  
    The equation has just one parameter $\zeta$ (zeta) for the
    engineer to design. The problem is, what value should she choose?

    We can solve this equation with the same recipe as above: (1)
    assume a $\phi=e^{st}$ is a solution; (2) substitute into the
    differential equation to find an equation for $s$; (3) solve <i>that</i> equation
    for $s$.

    Step 1: $$ \phi = e^{st} $$

    Step 2: $$ s^2\cancel{e^{st}}+2\zeta s \cancel{e^{st}} +
    \cancel{e^{st}} = 0 $$

    Step 3: $$ s = -\zeta \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} $$

    Now, with hardly any further maths, we can see what happened to
    the bridge. Say $\zeta$ is less than zero and greater than -1
    ($-1<\zeta<0$). Then the square-root value is imaginary part of $s$ (which we called $b$ above) and the
    real part of $s$ is $\zeta$ ($a$ above), which is <b>positive</b>.

    $$
    y = e^{st} = e^{at}e^{ibt} 
    $$

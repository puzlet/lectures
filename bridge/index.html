<h1>Complex Numbers, bridge example</h1>

<p class='heading'>Martin Clark and Gary Ballantyne<br>May 2016</p>

<div class='box-1-1'>
  
  <p>Complex numbers often appear in engineering; the suspension of a
  car, the electronics in a phone, skyscrapers and bridges all use
  complex numbers in their design. However, the most important (and
  interesting) examples are advanced&mdash;so, when you <i>start</i>
  learning about complex numbers it can appear that they have little
  practical use.</p>

  <p>Here we show the role complex numbers play in the <a
  href='https://youtu.be/3mclp9QmCGs'> self-destruction of a
  bridge</a> (i.e., a failure of design). Although it is an <a
  href='http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2010/readings/supp_notes/MIT18_03S10_Appendix_B.pdf'>
  advanced example, </a> we only assume you know about
  differentiation. Some details we will hurry past, and other
  important aspects we will not even glance at. Nevertheless, it will
  give you a taste of the place of complex numbers in actual
  engineering.</p>
  
  <p>Differentiation is about <i>change</i>, and systems that change
  with <i>time</i> are known as <b>dynamic systems</b> (for example, a
  car's suspension when it hits a bump). Dynamic systems are described
  by differential equations&mdash;that is, an equation involving
  differentials of some quantity (say $y$). Just for example,
  consider</p>
  
  $$ \frac{dy}{dt}+y=0 $$
    
  <p>It's worth pausing to think just what this equation says. There
  is a function of time, $y=y(t)$; we don't know what it is (but we'd
  like to); we only know that the sum of the function and its first
  derivative is zero. Most often we get equations like this from the
  underlying physics (or chemistry, or whatever)&mdash;we get
  <i>clues</i>, but not the solution.</p>
  
  <p>Typically a solution to the differential equations you'll
  encounter (including the one above) is</p>

  $$ y=e^{st} $$

  <p> where $s=\sigma+i\omega$ is a <b>complex</b> number that we have
  to (somehow) find. For example, say $s=-1+i0$. (OK, this is not
  <i>truly</i> complex ... but hang in there.) Then, substituting into
  the differential equations gives</p>

  $$
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{dy}{dt}+y &=& se^{st}+e^{st} \nonumber \\
  &=& -1e^{-t}+e^{t} \nonumber \\
  &=& 0
  \end{eqnarray}
  $$

  <p>In other words, $y=e^{st}$, with $s=-1$ is $y=e^{-t}$, which is a
  solution to the differential equation above.</p>

  <p>Before we consider a differential equation that requires a
  genuinely complex $s$, let's first consider what $y=e^{st}$ looks
  like. Substituting $s=\sigma+i\omega$: </p>

  $$ 
  \begin{eqnarray} 
  y &=& e^{st} \nonumber \\ 
  &=& e^{(\sigma+i\omega)t} \nonumber \\ 
  &=& e^{\sigma t + i\omega t} \nonumber \\
  &=& e^{\sigma t}e^{i\omega t} \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray} $$

  <p> So, $y=e^{st}$ is the product of <i>two</i>
  exponentials&mdash;one real, and one complex. We know how the
  complex exponential ($e^{i\omega t}$) behaves from an <a href=''>
  earlier lecture </a>. Recall that $e^{i\theta}$ is a point in the
  complex plane at angle $\theta$ and modulus (distance from the
  origin) of one&mdash;so $e^{i\omega t}$ is a point whose angle
  ($\omega t$) changes as time $t$ increases. In other words,
  $e^{i\omega t}$ draws a circle in the complex plane.</p>

  <div id='lecture-slider-t'></div>
  <div id='lecture-plot-w'></div>

  <p> On the other hand, $e^{\sigma t}$ is just a regular exponential
  function. For positive values of $\sigma$, as $t$ increases,
  $e^{\sigma t}$ will get bigger, and for negative values of $\sigma$,
  $e^{\sigma t}$ will get smaller.
  </p>

  <div id='lecture-slider-a'></div>
  <div id='lecture-plot-a'></div>
    
  <p>When we multiply $e^{\sigma t}$ and $e^{i\omega t}$ to get
  $e^{st}$, we combine both behaviours&mdash;the first term changes
  the modulus, and the second term causes a rotation in the complex
  plane.</p>
    
  <div id='lecture-slider-real'></div>
  <div id='lecture-slider-imag'></div>
  <div id='lecture-plot-s'></div>

  <p> How did we know that the right value of $s$ above was $s=-1$?
  Just substitute $y=e^{st}$ into the differential equation and solve
  for $s$:</p>

  $$
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{dy}{dt} + y = 0 \nonumber \\
  s e^{st} + e^{st} = 0 \nonumber \\
  s \cancel{e^{st}} + \cancel{e^{st}} = 0 \nonumber \\
  s + 1 = 0 \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  $$

  <p> Obviously, then, the solution is $s=-1$. And, our recipe to
  solve differential equations is: substitute $y=e^{st}$ and solve for
  $s$. </p>

  <p>Important problems, such as <a
  href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling'>Newton's
  law of cooling</a> are close cousins of the differential equation
  above. But, we need to go a little further&mdash;be just a little
  more ambitious&mdash;to understand what happened to the bridge.</p>
     
  <p>Say $y$ is the angle of the bridge's (dynamic) twisting. Physics
  tells us something about <i>about</i> $y$:</p>

  $$ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 2\zeta\frac{dy}{dt} + y=0 $$
  
  <p>Here $\zeta$ (zeta) is a <i>designed
  parameter</i>&mdash;engineers selected it through their choice of
  the bridges materials, structures and their assumptions about the
  environment (including the wide). Let's say $\zeta$ is greater than
  -1 but less than 1 ($-1<\zeta<1$). We can solve this equation with
  the same recipe as above; substituting $y=e^{st}$ we have</p>

  $$ \begin{eqnarray} 
  s^2\cancel{e^{st}}+2\zeta s \cancel{e^{st}} + \cancel{e^{st}} &=& 0 \nonumber \\ 
  s^2+2\zeta s + 1 &=& 0 \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray} 
  $$

  <p>The equation above is a <i>quadratic equation</i>&mdash;we seek
  the two values of $s$ for which the left-hand side (LHS) equals
  zero. It's worthwhile considering what the LHS looks like for
  <i>real</i> values of $s$: </p>

  <div id='lecture-plot-quad'></div>
  <div id='lecture-slider-quad'></div>

  <p>Note that (in the range of $\zeta$ we're considering), for
  real $s$, the LHS is never zero. So, to get a solution, we need to
  look for <i>complex</i> $s$. Solve for $s$ by completing the square:
  </p>
    
  $$ 
  \begin{eqnarray} 
  s^2+2\zeta s + 1 &=& 0 \nonumber \\
  s^2 + 2\zeta s +(\zeta^2 - \zeta^2) + 1 &=& 0 \nonumber \\
  (s^2 + 2\zeta s + \zeta^2) - \zeta^2 + 1 &=& 0 \nonumber \\
  (s+\zeta)^2-\zeta^2+1&=&0 \nonumber \\
  (s+\zeta)^2&=&\zeta^2-1 \nonumber \\
    s+\zeta &=& \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} \nonumber \\ 
  s &=& -\zeta \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray} 
  $$

  <p>Here, the value inside the square-root above is <i>negative</i>
  (since $-1<\zeta<1$), and so the square-root itself is the
  <b>imaginary</b> part of $s$. The <b>real</b> part of $s$ is the bit
  that <i>isn't</i> in the square root:</p>

  $$
  \sigma = -\zeta
  $$

  <p>So, if $\zeta$ is negative ($\zeta<0$), then $\sigma$ is positive
  ($\sigma>0$). Recalling that $y=e^{st}=e^{\sigma t}e^{i\omega
  t}$&mdash;can you see what happened to the bridge? If you were the
  engineer that designed the bridge, what value of $\zeta$ would you
  choose?</p>

  <p>Many engineers hardly ever consider differential equations
  directly (if at all). Instead, complex numbers allow them to focus
  just on the critical values of $s$&mdash;since these determine the
  behaviour of their system. Technically, these special complex
  numbers are known as the "poles" and "zeros" (something to look
  forward to at engineering school).</p>
  
  <p>Finally, let's consider what $y=y(t)$ really looks like. The
  quadratic equation gave us two values for $s$ (from the $\pm$ of the
  square root)&mdash;call them $s_1$ and $s_2$. By themselves,
  $e^{s_1t}$ and $e^{s_2}t$ are complex&mdash;but the twist of the
  bridge is <i>real</i>. The trick is to use <b>both</b> values for
  $s$&mdash; $y=e^{s_1t}+e^{s_2t}$. We'll skip the detail, but the
  plot shows the result (the $y$-axis shows the percentage of the
  initial twist).</p>

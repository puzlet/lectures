<h1>Complex Numbers, bridge example</h1>

<div class='box-1-1'>
  
  <p>Complex numbers appear often in science and engineering. The
    suspension of a car, the electronics in a phone, skyscrapers and
    bridges all use complex numbers in their design.</p>

  <p>However, the most important (and interesting) examples are
    advanced&mdash;so, when you <i>start</i> learning about complex
    numbers it can appear that they have little practical use. This is
    far from true.</p>
  
  <p>For example, complex numbers have a pivotal role in differential
    equations&mdash;perhaps the most powerful tool in
    mathematics. But, differential equations are not easy, and, for
    most, their first serious encounter will be at university. However,
    if we take a simple approach&mdash;focusing on what we <i>can</i> do,
    rather than what we can't&mdash; we can see why complex numbers
    are so important in the real-world.</p>

  <h2>Extending Eulers equation</h2>

  <p> Say we are designing a car's suspension, or phone's
    electronics&mdash;some <i>dynamic system</i> that changes with
    time ($t$). That system is very likely described by a differential
    equation: that is, an equation involving differentials of some
    quantity (say $y$). Just for example:</p>
  
  $$
  \frac{dy}{dt}+y=0
  $$
    
  <p>Let's first think carefully about what this equation says. There
    is a function of time, $y=y(t)$; we don't know what it is; we only
    know that the sum of the function and its first derivative is
    zero.</p>
  
  <p>Now, more often than not, a solution to the differential
    equations you'll encounter (including the one above) is</p>

  $$ 
  y=e^{st} 
  $$

  <p> where $s=\sigma+i\omega$ is a <b>complex</b> number that we have
    to (somehow) find. For example, say $s=-1+i0$, then</p>

  $$
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{dy}{dt}+y &=& se^{st}+e^{st} \nonumber \\
  &=& -1e^{-t}+e^{t} \nonumber \\
  &=& 0
  \end{eqnarray}
  $$


  <p>In other words, $y(t) = e^{-t}$ is a solution to our problem. To
    understand what $e^{st}$ looks like, consider</p>

  $$ \begin{eqnarray} y &=& e^{st} \nonumber \\ &=&
  e^{(\sigma+i\omega)t} \nonumber \\ &=& e^{\sigma t}e^{i\omega t}
  \nonumber \\ \end{eqnarray} $$

  <p> We know how $e^{i\omega t}$ behaves from an <a>earlier lecture</a>. Recall
    that $e^{i\theta}$ is a point in the complex plane at angle
    $\theta$ and modulus of one&mdash; so $e^{i\omega t}$ is a point
    whose angle ($\omega t$) changes as time $t$ increases. In other
    words, $e^{i\omega t}$ draws a circle in the complex plane.</p>

    <div id='lecture-slider-t'></div>
    <div id='lecture-plot-w'></div>

    <p> On the other hand, $e^{at}$ is just a regular exponential
    function. For positive values of $a$, as $t$ increases, $e^{at}$ will get bigger,
    and for negative values, $e^{at}$ will get smaller.
    </p>

    <div id='lecture-slider-a'></div>
    <div id='lecture-plot-a'></div>
    
    <p>When we multiply $e^{i\omega t}$ and $e^{i\sigma t}$ together
      to get $e^{st}$, we combine both behaviours&mdash;the first term
      gives us a rotation in the complex plane, and the second term
      changes the modulus.</p>

  <h2>Eigenstuff</h2>

  <p> How did we know that the right value of $s$ above was $s=-1$?
  All we had to do was substitute $y=e^{st}$ into the differential
  equation and solve for $s$:</p>

  $$
  \begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{dy}{dt} + y = 0 \nonumber \\
  s e^{st} + e^{st} = 0 \nonumber \\
  s \cancel{e^{st}} + \cancel{e^{st}} = 0 \nonumber \\
  s + 1 = 0 \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  $$

  <p> Obviously, then, the solution is $s=-1$. And, so our recipe is:
    substitute $y=e^{st}$ and solve for $s$. </p>


  <h2>Bridge</h2>
  

  <p>Important problems, such as 
    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling'>Newton's
      law of cooling</a> are close cousins of the differential
    equation above. But, we need to go a little further&mdash;be just
    a little more ambitious&mdash; to find a problem that needs a
    genuinely complex value for $s$.</p>
    
 
  <p>Check out this <a href='https://youtu.be/3mclp9QmCGs'>video</a>. The
    equation that describes the angle of the twist ($y$) of the bridge
    is </p>

    $$ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 2\zeta\frac{dy}{dt} + y=0 $$
  
  <p>where $\zeta$ (zeta) is a <i>designed parameter</i>&mdash;engineers
      selected it through their design choices. We can solve this
      equation with the same recipe as above; substituting $y=e^{st}$
      we have</p>

  $$ \begin{eqnarray} s^2\cancel{e^{st}}+2\zeta s \cancel{e^{st}} +
  \cancel{e^{st}} &=& 0 \nonumber \\ s^2+2\zeta s + 1 &=& 0
  \nonumber \end{eqnarray} $$

  <p>Now solve for $s$ by completing the square:
  </p>
    
  $$ \begin{eqnarray} (s+\zeta)^2-\zeta^2+1&=&0 \nonumber \\
  (s+\zeta)^2 &=& \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} \nonumber \\ s &=& -\zeta \pm
  \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} \nonumber \end{eqnarray} $$

  <p> Now, lets say $\zeta$ is less than zero and greater than -1
    ($-1<\zeta<0$). Then, the value of the square-root above is the
    imaginary part of $s$, and its real part is</p>

  $$
  \sigma = -\zeta \nonumber \\
  $$

  <p> Can you see what happened to the bridge? Note that $\sigma>0$,
    because $\zeta<0$&mdash;that is, $\sigma$ is <b>positive</b>.
    Recalling that $ y = e^{st} = e^{\sigma t}e^{i\omega
    t}$&mdash;what happens to $e^{\sigma t}$ as $t$ gets large (i.e.,
    as time progresses)?
  </p>

  <p>
    If you were the engineer that designed the bridge, what value of
    $\zeta$ would you choose?
  </p>

  <h2>s-domain</h2>
  
  <p>
    Many engineers hardly ever consider differential equations
    directly (if at all). Instead, complex numbers allow them to focus
    just on the critical values of $s$&mdash;since these determine the
    behaviour of their system. Technically, these special complex
    numbers are known as the "poles" and "zeros"&mdash;something to
    look forward to at engineering school.

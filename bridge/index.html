<h1>Complex Numbers, bridge example</h1>

  <p>Complex numbers appear often in science and engineering. The
    suspension of a car, the electronics in a phone, skyscrapers
    and bridges all use complex numbers in their design.</p>

  <p>However, the most important (and interesting) examples are
    advanced&mdash;so, when you <i>start</i> learning about complex
    numbers it can appear that they have little practical use. This is
    far from true.</p>
  
  <p>Differential equations are just about the most powerful
    mathematical tool available. By themselves, they are too advanced
    for us today. But, with complex numbers we can transform an
    interesting (and useful) differential equation into a (much
    easier) quadratic equation.</p>

  <h2>Extending Eulers equation</h2>

  <p> Say we are designing some dynamic system&mdash;car suspension,
    or electronics or whatever&mdash;something that changes with time
    ($t$). Chances are, a solution to that equation is

    $$ y=e^{st} $$

    Here $s=a+ib$ is a complex number that we have to somehow find.

    We can use Euler's equation to understand what $e^{st}$ looks like

    $$
    \begin{eqnarray}
    y &=& e^{st} \\ 
    &=& e^{a+ib} \\
    &=& e^{a}e^{ib} \\
    &=& e^{a} \left( \cos b + i\sin b \right)
    \end{eqnarray}
    $$

  <h2>Eigenstuff</h2>

  The question is, how do we find the right complex number $s$?  Lets
  consider our first (and the simplest) differential equation:

  $$ \frac{dy}{dt}=0 $$

  Substituting $y=e^{st}$, we have

  $$ se^{st} = 0 $$
  
  You can easily see that this equation is solved by $s=0$, so a
  solution is

  $$ y = e^{st} = e^{0t} = 1 $$

  And, thats pretty much our recipe: substitute $y=e^{st}$ and solve for $s$.

  <h2>Bridge</h2>

  <p> Much more interesting problems can be solved with the same recipe&mdash; including the design
    of bridges. Check out this  <a href='https://youtu.be/3mclp9QmCGs'>video</a>. In
    engineering, through design choices (materials, structures, etc.)
    sets the differential equation. In the case of this bridge, the
    equation that describes the angle of the twist ($\phi$) is

    $$ \frac{d^2\phi}{dt^2} + 2\zeta\frac{d\phi}{dt} + \phi=0 $$
  
    Here $\zeta$ (zeta) is a <i>designed parameter</i>&mdash;engineers
    chose it through their design choices.

    We can solve this equation with the same recipe as above;
    substituing $y=e^{st}$ we have

    $$
    \begin{eqnarray}
    s^2\cancel{e^{st}}+2\zeta s \cancel{e^{st}} +
    \cancel{e^{st}} &=& 0 \\
    s^2+2\zeta s + 1 &=& 0
    \end{eqnarray}
    $$

    The solutuions for s are then

    $$ s = -\zeta \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} $$

    Now, with hardly any further maths, we can see what happened to
    the bridge. Say $\zeta$ is less than zero and greater than -1
    ($-1<\zeta<0$). Then the square-root value is imaginary part of
    $s$ (which we called $b$ above) and the real part of $s$ is
    $\zeta$ ($a$ above), which is <b>positive</b>.

    
    $$
    y = e^{st} = e^{at}e^{ibt} 
    $$

  <h2>s-domain</h2>
  
  <p>Engineers who often design dyanmic systems very often don't even
  consider the differential equation directly&mdash;instead they
  understand the behaviour via the values of $s$. These special
  complex numbers are known as the "poles" and "zeros" of a
  system&mdash;something to look forward to at engineering school.</p>

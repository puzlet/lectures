<h1>Complex Numbers, bridge example</h1>
<p class='heading'>Martin Clark and Gary Ballantyne<br>May 2016</p>
<p class='heading highlight'>[This web page is currently under development.]</p>


<div class='box-2-1'>
  
  <p>Complex numbers appear often in science and engineering. The
    suspension of a car, the electronics in a phone, skyscrapers
    and bridges all use complex numbers in their design.</p>

  <p>However, the most important (and interesting) examples are
    advanced&mdash;so, when you <i>start</i> learning about complex
    numbers it can appear that they have little practical use. This is
    far from true.</p>
  
  <p>For example, <i>differential equations</i> are perhaps the most
  powerful tool in mathematics; and complex numbers are essential to
  their application. But, differential equations are not
  easy. However, if we take a simple approach&mdash;focusing on what
  we <i>can</i> do, rather than what we can't&mdash; we can appreciate
  the importance of complex numbers in the real-world.</p>

<div class='box-2-2'>

    Talk about what a differential equation actually is? Or leave
    postponed?

  <h2>Extending Eulers equation</h2>

  <p> Say we are designing a car's suspension, of phone's electronics&mdash;some <i>dynamic system</i> that
    changes with time ($t$). Chances are, the system is desribed by a
    differential equation with a solution

    $$ y=e^{st} $$

    Here $s=a+ib$ is a complex number that we have to (somehow) find.

    We can use Euler's equation to understand what $e^{st}$ looks like

    $$ 
    \begin{eqnarray} 
    y &=& e^{st} \nonumber \\ 
    &=& e^{(a+ib)t} \nonumber \\ 
    &=& e^{at}e^{ibt} \nonumber \\ 
    &=& e^{at} \left( \cos bt + i\sin bt \right) \nonumber
    \end{eqnarray} 
    $$

  <h2>Eigenstuff</h2>

  <p>
    How do we find the right complex number $s$?  Lets consider our
    first (and the simplest possible) differential equation:

    $$ \frac{dy}{dt}=0 $$
    
    This equation just says that $y$ doesn't change with time.
    Substituting $y=e^{st}$, we have

    $$ se^{st} = 0 $$
  
    This equation is solved by $s=0$, so a solution is

    $$ y = e^{st} = e^{0t} = 1 $$

    And, that's our recipe: substitute $y=e^{st}$ and solve for $s$.

  <h2>Bridge</h2>

  <p> 
    Much more interesting problems can be solved with the same
    recipe&mdash;including the design of bridges. Check out this  
    <a href='https://youtu.be/3mclp9QmCGs'>video</a>. In engineering,
    design choices (materials, structures, etc.) determine the
    differential equation. In the case of this bridge, the equation
    that describes the angle of the twist ($y$) is

    $$ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 2\zeta\frac{dy}{dt} + y=0 $$
  
    Here $\zeta$ (zeta) is a <i>designed parameter</i>&mdash;engineers
    selected it through their design choices. We can solve this
    equation with the same recipe as above; substituing $y=e^{st}$ we
    have

    $$ 
    \begin{eqnarray} 
    s^2\cancel{e^{st}}+2\zeta s \cancel{e^{st}} + \cancel{e^{st}} &=& 0 \nonumber \\ 
    s^2+2\zeta s + 1 &=& 0 \nonumber 
    \end{eqnarray} 
    $$

    We can solve for $s$ by completing the square:

    $$ 
    \begin{eqnarray} 
    (s+\zeta)^2-\zeta^2+1&=&0 \nonumber \\ 
    (s+\zeta)^2 &=& \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} \nonumber \\ 
    s &=& -\zeta \pm \sqrt{\zeta^2-1} \nonumber
    \end{eqnarray} 
    $$

    Now, with hardly any further math, we can see what happened to the
    bridge. Say $\zeta$ is less than zero and greater than -1
    ($-1<\zeta<0$). Then, the value of the square-root above is the
    imaginary part of $s$ (i.e., $b$) and the real part of $s$ is
    $-\zeta$ (i.e., $a$), which is <b>positive</b>.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Recalling that $ y = e^{st} = e^{at}e^{ibt}$&mdash;what happens to
    $e^{at}$ as $t$ gets large (i.e., as time progresses)? What would
    a better choice of $\zeta$ have been?
  </p>

  <p>
  Explain more about design? I.e., equation is not given to us, rather
  we get to say what it is.

  Illustrate effect of a and b graphically.

  <h2>s-domain</h2>
  
  <p>
    Many engineers hardly ever consider differential equations
    directly (if at all). Instead, complex numbers allow them to focus
    just on the critical values of $s$&mdash;since these determine the
    behaviour of their system. Technically, these special complex
    numbers are known as the "poles" and "zeros"&mdash;something to
    look forward to at engineering school.

  Math? $x$

  <!-- Complex numbers appear often in science and engineering. The
  suspension of your car, the electronics in your phone, skyscrapers and
  bridges all use complex numbers in their design.

  However, the most important (and interesting) examples are
  advanced&mdash;often appearing in *dynamic systems* where things
  change over time.  So, when you start learning about complex numbers
  it can appear that they have little practical use. This is far form
  true.

  The basic ingredient of a dynamic system are differentiation (e.g.,
  $\frac{dy}{dt}$) and cosines (e.g., $\cos \omega t$). With both these
  tools on your belt, you can appreciate how useful complex numbers are,
  and see how they are applied in real-world problems. -->

  <!-- To begin, first watch this short
  [video](https://youtu.be/3mclp9QmCGs).  The design of this bridge used
  the wrong complex number.

  The bridge is a dynamic system. Its twisting is described using
  differentiation&mdash;we call it a differential equation. If you
  haven't seen a differential equation before, it may look
  intimidating&mdash; but let's take it in steps.

  Consider this equation for the amount of twist, $\phi$ $$
  \frac{d^2\phi}{dt^2} +\phi = 0 $$ It's solution, $\phi$, is some
  function of time that when differentiated twice, and added to itself
  is zero. You can check for yourself that $\phi=\cos t$ is a solution.

  $$ \begin{eqnarray} \frac{d}{dt} \cos t &=& -\sin t \\ \frac{d^2 \cos
  t}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt}(-\sin t) &=& -\cos t \\ -\cos t + \cos t &=& 0
  \end{eqnarray} $$

  In this simple case, using cosines and sines (trigonometric functions)
  is OK.  But, as the problems become more comlicated, the level of
  trigonetry required quickly becomes a burden. Complex numbers to the
  rescue.

  As you have already found $$ \cos t= \frac{1}{2} \left( e^{it} +
  e^{-it} \right) $$ Now, lets just consider the $e^{it}$ part. Call it
  $X$. We can check that $X$ is also a solution

  $$ \begin{eqnarray} \frac{d}{dt} e^{it} &=& i e^{it} \\ \frac{d^2
  e^{it}}{dt^2} = \frac{d}{dt}(i e^{it}) &=& -e^{it} \\ -e^{it} + e^{it}
  &=& 0 \end{eqnarray} $$

  There are a couple of very important things to note. First.





  For lots of important differential equations a cosine is a
  solution. Sometimes it is OK to assume a solution and just find its
  parameters.

  $$ \frac{d^2\phi}{dt^2} +\phi = 0 $$

  $$ \phi = \cos(\omega t) $$

  $$ -\omega^2 \cos \omega t + 4 \cos \omega t = 0 $$

  $$ \omega = 2 $$


  $$ \phi(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left( e^{i\omega t} + e^{-i\omega t}\right)
  $$


  $$ \frac{d^2\phi}{dt^2} + 2d\frac{d\phi}{dt}+\phi = 0 $$

  $$ \Phi = e^{i\omega t} $$

  $$ \omega = 2 $$


  $$ x = A \cos \left( \omega t + \phi\right) $$

  for known $\omega$ and for some amplitude ($A$) and phase ($\phi$)
  that we have to find.

  Very often it is easier to rewrite $x$ as two **complex** parts,

  $$ x = \frac{1}{2} \left( \underbrace{Ae^{i\phi}e^{i\omega t}}_{X}+
  \underbrace{Ae^{-i\phi}e^{-i\omega t}}_{X^*} \right) $$

  and then work only with $X=Ae^{i\phi}e^{i\omega}$.

  For example, a common problem in electrical engineering is to find
  $X$, where

  $$ L\frac{dX}{dt} + RX = Y $$

  $L$ and $R$ are known constants, and $Y=Be^{i\omega t}$.

  $$ i\omega L A e^{i\phi} e^{i\omega t} + R A e^{i\phi} e^{i\omega t} =
  B e^{i\omega t} $$

  $$ Ae^{i\phi} = \frac{B}{i\omega L + R} $$ -->
